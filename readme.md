# Krishnized license

This is transcendental license, or reminder that eventually all results of our work belong to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.
Superficially in material world software and IP needs formal license to assign responsible or authoring person, but that's temporary designation.
Where ideas came from and where results will end up does not belong to any of us,
and the most meaningful action an intelligent man can take is to devote results of his/her work to the Supreme, which is called Karma-Yoga from ancient times.

That does not take any rights, responsibilities or limitations away from normal material-level license (MIT, ISC, BSD or any other).
