# Kṛṣṇzed

This is a reminder that in absolute sense all results of work belong to the Supreme.
<!-- Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa (also known as Allah, Jehovah and [thousands of other names]((https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/10/51/36/)))-->

Software and IP needs a formal license to assign authoring/responsible person and/or distribution limitations, but that's temporary designation. Where ideas come from and where results end up at does not belong to us, and the most meaningful action is devoting results to the Supreme. That _Karma-Yoga_ process is known from ancient times.

That does not supersede or take away any rights, responsibilities or limitations from material-level license (MIT, ISC, BSD, SIL or any other).
