This is a reminder that, in the absolute sense, all results of work belong to the Supreme.

While software and intellectual property (IP) require a formal license to define authorship, responsibilities, or distribution limitations, these are temporary material designations. The origin of all ideas and the ultimate destination of all results transcend our ownership. The most meaningful action is to dedicate these results to the Supreme. This process of _Karma-Yoga_, is known since ancient times and is described in [BG 3.9](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/3/9/) and [BG 12.10](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/12/10/).

“Work done as a sacrifice for the Supreme must be performed; otherwise, work binds one to the material world.”
