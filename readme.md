# Krishnized

This is a reminder that in absolute sense all results of work belong to the Supreme.
<!-- Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa (also known as Allah, Jehovah and [thousands of other names]((https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/10/51/36/)))-->

Software and IP needs a formal license to assign authoring/responsible person and/or distribution limitations, but that's temporary designation. Where ideas come from and where the results end up does not belong to us, and the most meaningful action is devoting the results to the Supreme. That process is called _Karma-Yoga_ from ancient times.

That does not take any rights, responsibilities or limitations away from material-level license (MIT, ISC, BSD or any other).
