# Kṛṣnized

This is a reminder that, in the absolute sense, all results of work belong to the Supreme.
<!-- Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa (also known as Allah, Jehovah and [thousands of other names]((https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/10/51/36/)))-->

While software and intellectual property (IP) require a formal license to define authorship, responsibilities, or distribution limitations, these are temporary material designations. The origin and destination of all ideas, as well as and the ultimate owner of all results, is the Supreme. The most meaningful action is to dedicate these results to the Supreme. This process is known as _Karma-Yoga_ and is described in [BG 3.9](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/3/9/), [BG 12.10](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/12/10/) and [BG 18.46](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/18/46/).

“Work done as a sacrifice for the Supreme must be performed; otherwise, work binds one to the material world.”

This license does not override or alter the terms specified by the material-level license (e.g., MIT, ISC, BSD, SIL, etc) and maintains them as societal duty (viśva-dharma).
