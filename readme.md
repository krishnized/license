# Kṛṣṇzed

This is a reminder that in the absolute sense all results of work belong to the Supreme.
<!-- Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa (also known as Allah, Jehovah and [thousands of other names]((https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/10/51/36/)))-->

Software and IP needs a formal license to assign authoring/responsible person and/or distribution limitations, but that is a temporary designation. Where ideas come from and where results end up, do not belong to us, but the most meaningful action is devoting results to the Supreme. That _Karma-Yoga_ process is known from ancient times.

That does not supersede or take away any rights, responsibilities or limitations from material-level license (MIT, ISC, BSD, SIL or any other).
